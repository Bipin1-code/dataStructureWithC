📚 Data Structures with C

Welcome to the Data Structures with C repository! This collection showcases a variety of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in the C programming language. It's designed to aid students, educators, and developers in understanding and applying core concepts of computer science.

🚀 Features:

Comprehensive Coverage: Includes implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, sorting algorithms, and more.
Clean Code: Each program is written in standard C with clear comments to enhance readability and understanding.
Educational Resource: Ideal for academic purposes, coding interviews, and self-study.

📂 Repository Structure:

The repository is organized into individual C files, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm. For example:
linkedList.c – Implementation of singly linked list operations.
stackInC.c – Stack operations using arrays.
mergeSort.c – Merge Sort algorithm in C.
librarySystem.c – A simple library management system using data structures.
Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently.

🛠️ Getting Started:

To clone and run the repository locally:

git clone https://github.com/Bipin1-code/dataStructureWithC.git

cd dataStructureWithC

gcc -o outputFileName sourceFileName.c

./outputFileName

Replace sourceFileName.c with the desired C file, and outputFileName with your preferred executable name.

📘 Usage:

Each program is designed to be run independently. Upon execution, most programs will display a menu or prompt to guide you through the available operations. 
For example, the librarySystem.c program allows you to:

Add new books.
Search for books.
Delete books.
Display all books.

🔧 Contributing:

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or additional data structures to include, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
