This repository contains the inforamation about #Data Structure and Algorithms implementation With C
All the implementation and example are highly used in real life scenarios.
Note:  All these programs or codes can be farther optimize. Try to figure out the most efficient approach or strategy which follow up, "modularity, efficient and less time and space complexity".
      Above present codes are just the examples of first step.
      In Future I'll also update code with more effective strategy.
      Stay tune... and Don't forgot to follow.
