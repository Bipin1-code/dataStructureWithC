This repository contains the inforamation about #Data Structure and Algorithm implementation With C
All the implementation and example are highly used in real life scenarios.
Note:  All these programs or code can be farther optimize And try to figure out the most efficient approach or strategy which fellow modularity, efficient and less time and space complexity
      Above present codes are just the example of first step.
      In Future I'll also update code with more effective strategy to do same work.
      Stay tune... and Don't forgot to fellow.
